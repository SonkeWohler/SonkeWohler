## Hello World out there!
<!-- [Arch Linux](https://img.shields.io/badge/Arch_Linux-1793D1?style=for-the-badge&logo=arch-linux&logoColor=white) -->

#### My name is Sönke Wöhler.  
I enjoy knowing enough about everything to get things done and talking about Linux.

One day I would like to animate the entire human proteome on a Raspberry Pi, but that will have to wait a little bit longer.

*"If I don't know how to do it on command line I don't really understand it properly at all."*

This used to be a good mantra to push me to learn, but today it's just how I work.  It allows a lot of easy personalisation to better manage my attention and working memory, so once the Hyperfocus sets in I don't have to interrupt it until I realise I was supposed to get off work three hours ago.

I have a template CV and cover letter as pdf [here](https://github.com/SonkeWohler/SonkeWohler/releases/tag/cv1.0.0).  They are a little outdated now, but that's probably because I haven't switched work places in a while.
