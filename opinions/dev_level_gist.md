# How Much do You Understand in Your Project Plan?

A Junior Dev understands what the project is supposed to look like when it is
done.  A Mid-Level Dev understands what the code will likely look like given
realistic expectations, when it is done.  A Senior Dev understands what the
code looks like today and what it will look like by the end of the month, the
year and by the time it gets recycled, discontinued or replaced.  A Legendary
Dev understands what the code looks like today, what it will look like
tomorrow, by the end of the week and the end of the month, and that's all your
can really predict anyway.
