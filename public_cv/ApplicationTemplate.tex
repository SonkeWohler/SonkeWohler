  % something subtle I like to do is to adapt the colours to the

  % sure how well that pops as compared to using my own colour-scheme.
  %
  % If you try that make it very subtle and almost unnoticeable.  The point is
  % not for recruiters to notice but to feel familiar in a way they don't notice.

  Dear People who found my Application Templates,  \\
  Dear Recruiters, curious Colleagues and random Strangers on the Internet,
  
%%% Statement
%%% ------------------------------------------------------------
  \sepspace 

  \noindent  You might not have posted a job offer, but if You are reading this
  anyway You could probably use somebody on Your team who loves to make
  complicated things simple and knows their way around a codebase - or more
  importantly the pipelines and people surrounding it.

  \sepspace
  
  \noindent  While my understanding of software development has been centered
  around Java and its OOP approach since High-school I quickly realised that it
  is the workflow around the code that really sets me apart. In my very first
  project - the iHP - it was difficult for the stake holders with backgrounds
  in hydrocarbon engineering and business to communicate their requirements to
  our team of developers.  Despite having no knowledge of the field myself, my
  study of physics allowed me to build on some common ground with the petroleum
  engineers and hence gave me a better grasp of the project requirements. When
  communicating this understanding within the team it often came naturally that
  I documented design decisions made by the team to then communicate these to
  management and stakeholders.  As such my role as a communicator within and
  without the team was likely my most notable impact which I have carried on in
  all my projects thus far.

  \sepspace

  \noindent  This people and pipeline work is what I am most proud of.  Anybody
  can learn how to code and picking up new languages shouldn't be a large
  undertaking to a skilled developer, but to understand the way useful ideas
  are hatched and what can be done to help them along is what I am offering.  A
  talent for turning business information into business logic across
  backgrounds, application layers and cultures.  It is at this point that I
  would normally talk about what I hope to get out of employment with You,
  which is difficult to formulate as a template.  My main motivation is that I
  found myself in this country for personal reasons and I would like to stay
  here.  In the time it takes me to learn the language properly and integrate I
  would also like to continue developing professionally.  The more I get to
  learn, the more new industries and work-cultures I am exposed to the happier
  I will be.

  \sepspace
  
  \noindent  If You have use for somebody who knows their way around software
  but who doesn't want to stand still while integrating in a new country, I
  think You will be impressed by me - and not just by the amount of time I can
  spend talking about my Linux setup.

  \sepspace

  \sepspace

  \noindent
  Looking forward to hearing from You.
